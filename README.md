###Inspiration

Deep in sub-saharan Africa, many countries are plagued by the remnants of structural adjustment programs, widespread corruption, and stunted healthcare systems unable to provide for citizens. Vulnerable communities suffer from a lack of access to vital vaccines at clinics, and are unable to locate where they could even get their immunizations complete. From our collective understanding of this global health climate and personal experiences, we were aware that although many non-governmental organizations and local ministries operate in these nations, inefficiencies in resource management and distribution result in consistent error and loss of funds. As a result, tangible improvements at the expected magnitude are absent. Such a harsh reality puts the privileges our society grants in perspective. However, we CAN make a difference. By building a resource management platform that could help individuals understand their immunizations, vaccine records, and new vaccines to take in accordance with connecting to village pharmacies, Vaccicheck aims to help alleviate this global health crisis with the power of technology.

### What it does

Vaccicheck aims to assist communities with developing healthcare systems as a end-to-end vaccine management tool! Enabling residents with a private yet usable portal, it becomes possible to safely keep track of immunization records AND register for where/when to administer their next vaccinations. Vaccicheck also intends to make it easy for clinics across regions to digitize and stay connected with patients for smarter, more efficient vaccine deployment.
